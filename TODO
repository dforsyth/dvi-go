- Proper editing
- All buffers on a window should share a map (or, should they?)
- in the editbuffer, line numbers should be line indexes, since they are 0
  indexed.
? seperate front and backend and connect them over network, so ui can run in one place, and file manipulation can happen in another (sam-y?)
